# PostgreSQL initialization

If you are unexperienced with postgresql and have it freshly installed, run

    initdb --locale en_US.UTF-8 -E UTF8 -D '/var/lib/postgres/data'

as user postgres. Then run (as root):

    systemctl enable postgresql.service

# PostgreSQL configuration

If postgresql isn't running, start it with

    systemctl start postgresql.service

as root. Now, to have a pepa user and database in your postgresql database, run

    psql -c "CREATE USER pepa"
    psql -c "CREATE DATABASE pepa OWNER pepa"

as user postgres.

Now, as root again, run

    echo host pepa pepa 127.0.0.1/32 trust >> /var/lib/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf

Now, restart postgres (as root):

    systemctl restart postgresql.service

Now, you can follow `installation.md` for further instructions.
