# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites

This part of the installation guide assumes you have a working
PostgreSQL installation as well as the necessary applications
installed.

- Java (at least version 7)
- [Leinigen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/)
- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/)
- [PDFtk](http://www.pdfhacks.com/pdftk)

### Optionally (for OCR):

- [CuneiForm](https://launchpad.net/cuneiform-linux)
- [Tesseract-OCR](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).

You can follow the instructions in the following documents to set up
the necessary dependencies as well as PostgreSQL:

- [./installation-arch.md](installation-arch.md)
- [./installation-debian.md](installation-debian.md)

## Installation

### Schema Import

After starting PostgreSQL, you have to import the database schema. If
the postgres user is called `pepa`, you can run the following:

    lein run -m pepa.tasks schema | psql -U pepa pepa

### Generating Javascript

For the web client you have to generate javascript code from
ClojureScript:

    lein cljsbuild once

### Generating a JAR file

Now you can generate a runnable JAR file:

    lein uberjar

The result is in `target/uberjar/pepa-<version>-standalone.jar`. You
are free to move this file around. You can also copy it to a different
system and run it there, as long as the `Prerequisites` and
`config.clj` (see next sections) are available there.

### Configuration

Create a file called `config.clj` by copying the sample config:

    cp resources/config.sample.clj config.clj

Adapt the configuration file to your needs. One necessary change is to
add the correct database host (by replacing the `<dbhost>`
placeholder).

Other interesting config options include the port the application
should listen on (default `4035`) and if you want to enable various
features like the `LPD` print server or the SMTP server.

### Running the JAR

With the jar generated and `config.clj` in the current folder, you can
run it just as any other JAR file:

    java -jar pepa-<version>-standalone.jar

Just make sure you have your `config.clj` in the current directory so
Pepa can find it. Optionally, you can set the environment variable
`PEPA_CONFIG` to the path to your `config.clj` in case it's in a
different directory
